A tool to ease Lambda Functions development for Applications using Api Gateway

### About Vertgo
---
Vertgo is a microframework that provides tools to make 
it easier to develop api's using the AWS Lambda Function and API Gateway. 
Lambda Forest attempts to make the development faster by providing a way to create a single Lambda
Function to serve multiple endpoints. That is achieved using [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/).

Some tools:
* Routing
* Serializations for inputs and responses
* Custom configurations
* Request validation
